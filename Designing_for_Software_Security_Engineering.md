### Threat Mitigation and Identified Gaps

**Alfawzan**:



**Farjad**:
Some expected mitigations are already present: Salt is configured to use master–minion key-based authentication, basic artifact integrity checks via hashes in the CI pipeline, logging through system/Salt logs, and mostly HTTPS/TLS for repository and CI communication. When artifacts or checks fail, deployments generally fail closed, which matches the assumptions from our threat model.

However, I also observed several gaps:
- Salt Role-Based Access Control (external_auth, fine-grained permissions) and centralized SSO/MFA for admins are not fully configured.

- Logging is not centralized or audit-grade (no dedicated SIEM or append-only audit trail).

- TLS and certificate validation are not explicitly enforced and documented for all internal flows.

- The artifact repository is not deployed in a true HA (High Availability) configuration, and explicit rate/resource limits are missing.

- The Pre-flight Verification Gate and Salt Minions are not fully hardened (least-privilege accounts, sandboxing, module allow-lists).

### Team Reflection:

**Alfawzan**:



**Farjad**:
This was my first time using a threat modeling tool. I was surprised to see how the Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool generated threats based on our DFD. These threats were similar to what I was  expecting in prior assignments. I also learned how trust boundaries, layered segmentation, and sanity checks contribute to improving the security of a system. The most useful takeaway from this assignment was developing a security mindset and understanding how multiple layers are important for improving the security of the system under consideration.

# Progress & Contribution Planning

**Current Status:** This assignment gave us focused direction on the identified gaps, which we can now prioritize and address with the intent to make real contributions to the Salt codebase.

**Next Steps:** We plan to study these gaps in more detail and target a subset of them for pull requests to the SaltStack codebase. We will also consider the feasibility of each gap based on the effort required and the limited time available.

Saltâ€™s install guide is friendly, but the security steps for safe remote deployment are scattered. Add one clear Secure Remote Deploy path that limits deploy rights with eAuth and publisher ACLs so only a Release Engineer can run state.orchestrate in production, turns off auto_accept and open_mode and uses TLS on TCP, enforces file integrity with source_hash or signed files while GitFS uses tags only in production with repos pinned to a commit, and standardizes secrets with Pillar GPG or Vault with a note to avoid logging them. Include a tiny orchestrate example that does a canary or batch rollout, sends results to an external job store with a returner, and performs automatic rollback when checks fail, plus a short CI to CD snippet that shows staging to production.
